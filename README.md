# cpp4project

Hi there. Here is my code for the project ViewHKL for RAL.
It has a very basic html backbone (in order to make it as dynamic as possible) and accompanying javascript files which provide functions for reading and parsing the binary mtz file and transferring key content to a tabular format on the website.

Thank you,

Junho Choi
